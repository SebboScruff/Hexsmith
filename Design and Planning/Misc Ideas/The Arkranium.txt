** THE ARKRANIUM ** 

This is a building that serves as the player's base - an isolated tower in a safe area of the map, where they can undertake a variety of miscellaneous tasks. It is reached by either going to it in the overworld map, or casting Withdraw (1 mana of any colour, in the Conjuration School). Some of the features of the Arkranium are:

Writing Desk: 
	-> Going here will fill in the player's journal with details of every new spell they invoked since the last time they went to the desk.
		-> Although the journal is accessible from anywhere, records of the player's previously invoked spells will not be updated automatically. 
		-> Spells in the journal are categorised primarily by School, and serve exclusively as a reference for players who may have forgotten a combination

Wardrobe:
	-> Allows for player customisation, equipping new clothes with both cosmetic and mechanical changes
		-> Different clothes offer benefits such as mana regeneration bonuses

Exoportal: 
	-> Allows for travel to the overworld: from the Exoportal, a destination is selected and the player is sent there after a loading screen. Various Checkpoints can be found around the map that allow the player different access points from the Exportal

Porthole of Self Discovery:
	-> Going here will open the player's skill tree, allowing them to enhance various aspects of themselves
		-> There is an upgrade path for Mana Colours, and one for Magic Schools
		-> Paths offer benefits like damage/range upgrades, cast cost reductions, etc.

Training Grounds: 
	-> A place for the player to freely try different spell combos on a stationary, invincible target dummy
	-> Contains the Duplicity Forge:
		-> After defeating a certain number of a specific enemy in the overworld, a duplication of it can be created to practice against in the Training Grounds.
		-> These duplications cannot kill the player, but they behave exactly as they would in the overworld.
		-> The Duplicity Forge also doubles as a way to learn detailed information about different enemy types - HP, behaviour description, etc.
